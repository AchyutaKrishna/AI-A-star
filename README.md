# AI-project

The aim of the project is to find the shortest distance between two points on a map.

The latitudes and longitudes of the locations were identified using geopy.geoencoders. The distance between the points were obtained using Map Quest API. The distances were used as the edge weights in implementing the A-star algorithm to find the shortest distance between two points.
